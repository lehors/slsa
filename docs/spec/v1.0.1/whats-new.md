SLSA v1.0.1 is a reformatting of SLSA v1.0. It is not intended to bring new functionality or requirements. The changes it brings are primarily editorial in nature.

## Summary of changes

SLSA v1.0 introduced the notion of tracks and defines the Build Track. SLSA v1.0.1 is a distilled version of 1.0 in which general introductory material was left out and where the Build Track is brought into a separate specification to provide for a structure that will allow easier management of additional tracks.
